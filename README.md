# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

This is version 2.0
Notes for each section have been separated into their own pages.
Content for the pages is loaded from a .MD file, this was done to make taking notes easier (MD syntax  is a lot cleaner to work with).
There is a link to the required prework on each page
