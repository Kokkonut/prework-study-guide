# Git Notes

git clone (pasted from git) | clones got repo to local machine
### Git Workflow
    git add -A
    git commit -m "bla bla"
    git push origin feature/blabla

Consider a commit like a snapshot of your code the moment the commit was made
Best practice to commit every time you have a meaningful change in code

## 7 rules of great Git commit messages
- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

Use vsCode for commit msgs
